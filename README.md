## Usage

```bash
$ ./cli.py --currency USD 1 --exchange MXN <- Mexican Peso
20.40 MXN
```

`--currency` requires the currency (USD for now) and the amount  
`--exchange` currency to exchange to (MXN, EUR, AUD) (Peso, Euro, Australian Dollar) (for now)  
`--request` tests if the api works with the key
